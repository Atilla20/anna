                    I'm a developer. I hiccup abnormally, drink lots of coffee, and paint both digitally and traditionally on the 
                    side in the hopes of getting a side art business up off the ground. I am also very fascinated with the idea of coding with css to create art.
                    Not only that but I've started planning an app game with one of my SCAD friends as a fun side project.
                    Officially, I create apps. But really I create art. Which really means I am an artist. Which is a fancy way of saying I love 
                    what I do. I love learning, so I've gained a lot of knowledge/skills from marketing, design and front-end developer internships.
                    I am looking for a creative work space to continue growing my skills and knowledge as a developer.
